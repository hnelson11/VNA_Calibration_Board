###PCB Layout Constraints Document

System Requirements: 
The VNA Calibration board must have a through and an open connection to SMA connectors to provide a proper calibration to the VNA.
A lowpass filter was added to the last SMA connection on the PCB. 
This was to see the characteristics of a lowpass filter through the VNA, but different filter configurations are applicable.

Electrical Requirements:
A VNA is required for this test structure. 
Trace impedance must match 50 ohms, a trace width of 0.025 was used to produce impedance.
SMA connectors must be connected to the ground shapes located on the top side of the board.
SMAs must be a solid fill, to fix thermal relief concerns. 
Output trace of SMAs depends on configuration, open, through, lowpass filter.
Resistors 0603 and capacitor 0603 are located to fullfill lowpass filter.
Characteristics will be checked for filter.

Physical Constraints:
A standard FR-4 board must be used. 

Layer Stackup:
The layer stackup for the VNA calibration board is set as a 2-layer board. 
This board can be laser cut, but vias will need to be drilled as well. 

Design Rules:
To ensure no signal integrity problems occur during the Vector network analyzer calibration, the distance between the ground shape and output trace between SMA 
connectors on either end of the board needs to be a length of at least 0.47mm. This was found through a microstrip calculator. 
Additionally, it is also important to check the distance between both SMA connectors located on across the PCB.
This distance should follow the 3*Width theory, and will at a minimum need to be 1.41mm. 
These requirements are necessary to ensure that the IPC-2221 Standard is upheld.

Note: A clean ERC and DRC are required before design can be manufactured.

Manufacturing Requirements:
Download gerber files and ensure layout is accurately placed.
